Its linear response and disciplined voicing make it ideal for desktop setups through medium-sized rooms.\n\nThe N1-9 can be expanded with the matching N1-9B bass module, transforming the system into a true three-way design while preserving the speaker's tonal integrity and imaging.\n\nRecommended: speaker risers\nExpandable: with N1-9B bass module",

The result is a deeper, more effortless presentation that maintains tonal continuity and spatial precision.\n\nDesigned as a matched extension, not a generic add-on, the N1-9B preserves the character of the N1-9 while expanding its capability for larger rooms and full-range listening.\n\nDesigned exclusively for: N1-9\nPlacement: floor-mounted, paired per channel\nResult: true three-way system with extended low-frequency and fuller mids.",
