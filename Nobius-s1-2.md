Nobius Audio S1-2
Honest sound. Refined for maximum fun. 
A compact sealed monitor designed for nearfield listening where clarity, coherence, and musicality matter most. Natural midrange presence, controlled warmth, and fatigue-free highs — built for long sessions where the music, not the speakers, should be what you notice.
12.7-liter sealed enclosure with phase-coherent crossover. Adjustable high-frequency voicing. Available as DIY kit or pre-built.
Response: 55 Hz – 17 kHz (±3 dB) • 8Ω • 84-86 dB • Up to 50W

S1-2
Honest Sound. Refined Performance.

Product Overview
The S1-2 is a nearfield monitor that balances measurement precision with musical engagement. Built around a 12.7-liter sealed enclosure and phase-coherent crossover, it's engineered for close listening. 
The S1-2 delivers natural midrange clarity, controlled low-mid warmth (+2 dB around 80-120 Hz), and extended but naturally rolled treble. It reveals detail without fatigue, images precisely without sounding clinical, and disappears into the music instead of calling attention to itself.
Measured Response: 55 Hz – 17 kHz (±3 dB, on-axis) with usable extension to 50 Hz (-6 dB) and smooth roll-off above 17 kHz.

Design Detail
Sealed Cabinet Architecture
The 12.7-liter sealed enclosure delivers fast transient response, tight bass control, and eliminates port noise. Sealed designs are more forgiving of boundary placement, making them ideal for desktop or near-wall positioning where bass can build up.
Phase-Coherent Crossover
Low-order topology refined through iterative measurement and listening. Prioritizes phase coherence and driver integration over steep slopes, resulting in stable imaging and natural presentation across the listening window.
Adjustable High-Frequency Voicing
Crossover jumper allows selection between two high-frequency settings (Warm / Reference) to match your room acoustics or personal preference.
Internal Construction
Cabinet damping optimized for transient speed and natural decay. Drivers selected and matched for consistent performance pair-to-pair.

Applications / Who Is It For?
Ideal Use Cases:
Nearfield monitoring at 0.5-2.5 meters
Desktop audio systems
Small-room listening
2.0 is preferred over 2.1
Not ideal if you need:
Deep bass extension below 50 Hz
High SPL capability for large rooms
Maximum sensitivity for low-power amplifiers
